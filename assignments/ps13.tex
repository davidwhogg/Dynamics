\section*{PHYS-UA 120 Dynamics Problem Set 13}

\noindent
\emph{Due in the ``Dynamics'' hand-in box before noon on 2014 December 18.}

\begin{problem}
Integrate a trajectory starting at rest at x=0.01, y=0.95 in the
H\'enon--Heiles potential given on pp.~368--369.  Set $m=1$.  Note
that the textbook equations have bad units; the coordinates (including
time) have been implicitly made dimensionless.  Ignore that fact while
you solve the problem but then figure out (on your own; not for
credit) how that is possible.  Hand in a plot of a few time units of
the trajectory in the $x$--$y$ plane plus your code.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Reproduce Fig.~D.2 as well as you can.  The lines are \emph{fixed}
points (or limit cycles) of the map, so at each value of $r$ you step
through, you have to iterate the map to ``convergence'' and then plot
some (say) 128 points.  When the limit is a one-cycle, these points
will all hit at the same place, when it is a two-cycle, in two places,
and so on.  Hand in your figure and your code.
\end{problem}
